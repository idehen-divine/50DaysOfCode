# Day 1 - Hello, World!

## Summary
Today, I set up my Rust development environment and wrote my first programâ€”a simple "Hello, World!" application. This foundational step was essential to get started with Rust.

## What I Learned
- Installed Rust using `rustup`, which helps manage Rust versions and toolchains.
- Learned how to create a new Rust project using `cargo`, Rust's package manager and build system.
- Wrote a basic program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

### Example Code
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

## Code for Today
Check out the code in [`day01/main.rs`](./main.rs).

## Reflections
Writing my first Rust program was exciting! It helped me familiarize myself with the development tools and set the stage for more complex coding ahead.
