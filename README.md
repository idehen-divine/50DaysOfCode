# 50 Days of Rust ðŸ¦€ âœ¨

Welcome to my **#50DaysofRust** challenge! ðŸš€

## Overview
I joined the "50 Days of Rust" challenge to learn and grow my skills in the Rust programming language by coding every day for 50 days straight. This repository will contain my daily progress, code examples, and insights I gather throughout this journey.

## Goals
- Understand the basics of the Rust programming language.
- Build small projects or solve coding challenges using Rust.
- Develop backend solutions using Rust.
- Connect with developers from different walks of life.
- Continuously expand my understanding of Rust, including advanced features like ownership, borrowing, and concurrency.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

```
ðŸ“‚ 50DaysOfRust/
â”œâ”€â”€ day01/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.rs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ day02/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.rs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

Each folder (e.g., `day01`, `day02`) will contain the code I write each day.

## Daily Progress
- **Day 1**: Set up Rust environment and wrote a simple "Hello, World!" program.
- **Day 2**: Explored variables, constants, and basic data types.
- **Day 3**: Learned about basic data types in Rust, including integers, floats, booleans, characters, strings, tuples, arrays, and vectors.
